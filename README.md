- 👋 Hi, I’m @chocowgirl, but most people call me Jessica.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to code.  Starting with front-end and back-end coding, then maybe security and data?
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects in the future, particularly ones that address accessibility or sustainability issues.
- 📫 How to reach me: here on Github for now.  Once I'm a bit more 'pro', I'll post a link to my LinkedIn or something of that sort.
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her or they/them.
- ⚡ Fun facts: I have over 28 000 hours of experience in professional chocolatiering (particularly R&D and product development).
I was a graphic-design co-op student at Saatchi & Saatchi a zillion years ago.
I studied art after high-school, (so arty web-projects are hopefully in the future too)
I worked in the research industry (market and political research) for about 10 years, but that was almost a zillion years ago too.
I speak French and English fluently, my Spanish is... intermediate, and my Dutch is advanced beginner level.
